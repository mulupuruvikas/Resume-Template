# Resume-Template

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to show the code that I used to generate my resume. I pursued this because I wanted to have a method of creating and tweaking my resume easier without having to fix the formatting every time I do so. With the generator, I can tweak it a lot more without having to work on the formatting every time. 

## Features 
Text font packages, files of each subcategory of the resume

## Credits
Very large portion of the template used from:
